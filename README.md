Tasker Battery Manager.

This is an App Factory ready tasker project. The purpose of the project is to create a full fledged battery manager using tasker as its coding language.

The core idea behind starting this project is to have complete control of data through tasker so as to have reliable connectivity in other tasker projects running on the device. Thus the main highlight of the the battery manager are data locks: a forced data enabled/disabled state.

Although that idea started it, TBM packs many other capabilities for saving the juice.
Please refer wiki for further details.
